## General considerations  
The general objective is to estimate how many individual shrubs exist within the orthomosaic image-- accounting for the fact that many putative shrubs are false positives, and some real shrubs have not been detected (both errors have been confirmed). 
  
There are a few interesting elements First, shrubs with a modeled height of <0.1 m cannot be detected. See, for example:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
CellDat<-read.csv("data/model_input/celldat.csv")
SpDat<-read.csv("data/model_input/spdat_joint0.csv")
SpDat$z[SpDat$z==101]<-NA
# hist(SpDat$height[SpDat$y==1], main="Modeled Height, Detected")
```
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
SpDat %>% 
  filter(y == 1) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = height), fill = "gray", colour = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.1, linetype = "dashed", colour = "pink", size = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "CHM height, m", y = "Count") +
  theme_bw()
```
Considering the shrubs known to exist (but not detected), it seems likely that many missed 'real' shrubs are not detected specifically because their modeled height is < 0.1 m (8/9 non-detections have modeled height <.1 m and measured height > .1 m). So in some sense, detection is directly related to certain modeled inputs that are being fed as parameters to the Shrub ID algorithm. This is potentially important in that how one deals with this depends on how N is defined here--could think of N as the number of shrubs, the number of shrubs > 0.1 m tall (based on measurements), or the number of 'detectable' shrubs (with modeled height > 0.1 m tall.)

```{r}
# hist(SpDat$height[SpDat$y==0 & SpDat$z==1], main='Modeled Height, Missed')
# hist(SpDat$ht_true[SpDat$y==0 & SpDat$z==1], main='Measured Height, Missed')
SpDat %>% 
  filter(y == 0, z == 1) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = height), binwidth = .025, fill = "pink", colour = "black", alpha = .5) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = ht_true), binwidth = .025, fill = "lightgreen", colour = "black", alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "CHM vs True Height of Missed plants", x = "CHM height, m", y = "Count", legend = "Type") +
  theme_bw()
```
  
For reference, measured/modeled height relate pretty well, albeit with a sample of 28 (out of 2800 + detections).
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# plot(SpDat$height, SpDat$ht_true, xlab='modeled height', ylab='measured height', xlim=c(0, 1), ylim=c(0, 1), pch=18)
# abline(0, 1, lwd=2)
SpDat %>% 
  filter(z == 1) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = height, y = ht_true), size = 2) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, size = 1.5, linetype = "dashed", colour = "pink") +
  lims(x = c(0, .6), y = c(0, .6)) +
  labs(x = "CHM height, m", y = "True height, m") +
  theme_bw()
```
  
## Approach  
I think this is largely a supervised classification problem. There are a certain number of shrubs (n=30) known to exist in specific locations with a measured (n=28) and modeled height. There are a certain number (n=42) of known 'non-shrubs' in specific locations with a modeled (but not measured) height. The state of every other observed shrub is like a prediction based on the spatial or invidiual attributes of known shrubs/non-shrubs.  
  
So, maybe worth looking at this again. Here's the variation in (modeled) height across all possible classes. It certainly seems to me that the modeled height varies across false and true plants--that the true plants are, on average, maybe a little taller (or exhibit less skew) than the false plants.   
```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(3,2))
hist(SpDat$height[SpDat$y==1], freq = TRUE, main="Modeled Height, Detected", xlab = "CHM height, m", ylab = "Count")
hist(SpDat$height[SpDat$z==0], freq = TRUE, main="Modeled Height, Known False, Detected", xlab = "CHM height, m", ylab = "Count")
hist(SpDat$height[SpDat$z==1], freq = TRUE, main="Modeled Height, Known True", xlab = "CHM height, m", ylab = "Count")
hist(SpDat$height[SpDat$z==1 & SpDat$y==1], freq = TRUE, main="Modeled Height, Known True, Detected", xlab = "CHM height, m", ylab = "Count")
hist(SpDat$height[SpDat$z==1 & SpDat$y==0], freq = TRUE, main="Modeled Height, Known True, Not, Detected", xlab = "CHM height, m", ylab = "Count")
```


Another thing to check--environmental factors underlying the distribution of shrubs. Detected shrubs/pseudoshrubs are generally more common in the unburned region. (Note shown, but a poisson glm does not appear to exhibit, uh, great fit, so something to consider further).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(CellDat$dist, CellDat$n, xlab='distance to burn', ylab='detection count')
plot(CellDat$burn, CellDat$n, xlab='burn', ylab='detection count')
```
  
Narrowing in on known true or false plants, any association between burn distance and count is maybe a little more ambiguous.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
Trues<-SpDat[SpDat$z==1,] %>% group_by(cellid) %>% summarise(nT=n())
Falses<-SpDat[SpDat$z==0,] %>% group_by(cellid) %>% summarise(nF=n())
colnames(Trues)[1]<-'cid'
colnames(Falses)[1]<-'cid'

CellDat<-left_join(CellDat, Trues)
CellDat<-left_join(CellDat, Falses)

plot(CellDat$dist, CellDat$nF, ylab='N_True', xlab='Burn Distance')
plot(CellDat$dist, CellDat$nT, ylab='N_False', xlab='Burn Distance')
```
      
  
Anyway, a starting point is to imagine that real and false plants have both different height distributions and also different expected densities across the landscape (maybe real shrubs more uncommon in unburned areas, fake shrubs perhaps more likely to occur within the burned areas because there are more grass tufts of whatever). Below d_constraint is used to constrain the mean/dispersion for the height of non-existent plants to be less than the mean and height of real plants. False negative error might vary by size, but the reality at this point is that there's one plant we're known to have missed, so I think there's little information here to estimate such an effect (beyond the deterministic effect of modeled size).

###Recall:
###y=0, 1 depending on on whether individual shrub is seen or not
###z is sampled; 1=shrub truly exists, 0 = shrub does not truly exist
###most z's are unknown initially (NA).
###Two exceptions: there will be some shrubs we know are falsely detected
###y=1, but z=0
###There will be some shrubs that exist that we know are not detected
###z=1, y=0.

It takes long enough to run the above (maybe an hour) that I don't fit while knitting this (but encourage folks to grab the data off of Andrii's repository and execute this). Other reason is that some of the results are unstable across fits. What does seem stable are the kappa parameters--these relate true and modeled height and have reliably converged on consistent values indicating that modeled height is less than but positively associated with measured height. These mix particularly slowly, but there's a lot going on here--28 observations of the predictor, with others sampled from height distributions that vary by class. Generally, end up with an N-hat between 2000-3000, with 1000-1400 of the observed plants being 'real'. 
  
It does seem like there's a fair amount of sensitivity to how the height hyperparameters are initialized. In some cases, the means settle towards one edge of the priors, and beta[2,2] (the effect of distance to burn) ends up strongly positive. In other cases, beta[2,2] has been negative, and the height means by class have exhibited a little more distinctiveness.  
  
I suppose my initial thought is that there's an information shortage. There are shrubs of known class distributed across 18 cells, and 28 of the 'real' class have a measured height--so there may be multiple solutions, and the results may be pretty sensitive to the model specification. I guess I suspect that the model mis-specification is contributing (N is probably not a Poisson RV, maybe not cleanly related to burn distance, and certainly density/height/burn status should all covary), but also that there may not be enough info to reliably fit a more reasonably specified model? Could tighten up priors; suspect that additional verification post-hoc (maybe based on looking at the imagery) would help, but would want to do this in a fairly representative way.   
  
Anyway, would be curious to hear any further thoughts on how to proceeed here based on the code or output descriptions (or on any misinterpretations of the scope of the problem).
